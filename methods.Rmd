### Overview 

This document describes the methods used to delineate plausible values of the intrinsic transmissibility and immune evasion of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. It is structured in three parts:
 - A summary of Bayesian implementation of the model of vaccine efficacy
 - The extension of this Bayesian model to available data on Omicron
 - Details on model fitting by MCMC using the greta R package

### Vaccine efficacy model

The core of this analysis is a Bayesian implementation of a predictive model of vaccine efficacy documented and validated in [Khoury et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01377-8) and [Cromer et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00267-6). The original publications estimate parameters by maximum likelihood, and focus on predicting vaccine efficacies for different combinations of vaccine dose and product, the outcome against which efficacy is measured, and the SARS-CoV-2 variant, based on neutralising antibody titres. See those publications for detailed analysis and validation.

This model assumes that each immune individual $i$ in a population has some neutralisation level$n_{i,v}$ to variant $v$, given by the common (ie. base 10) logarithm of the titre of neutralising antibody, relative to the mean neutralisation level produced by infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. This indexing on wild-type convalescent neutralisation levels enables comparability between studies and across variants. The individual's neutralisation level is assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu_{s,d,v}$ differing based on the source of their immunity $s$ (e.g. the vaccine dose or product), the number of days $d$ post-peak immunity (ie. the degree of waning) and the variant, and with variance $\sigma^2$ giving the inter-individual variation in neutralisation levels - assumed to be constant across variants, sources of immunity, and levels of waning:

$n_{i,v} \sim N(\mu_{s,d,v}, \sigma^2)$
    
For each individual and for each type of outcome $o$ (e.g. death, severe disease, infection, onward transmission) the probability that the outcome is averted $E_{i,o}$ (the vaccine is effective for that outcome) is given by a sigmoid function, parameterised by a threshold neutralisation level $n_{o,50}$ at which 50% of outcome events are prevented, and a slope parameter $k$ determining the steepness of this relationship. Crucially, these parameters are assumed to independent of the variant and source of immunity, enabling prediction of vaccine efficacy to new situations.

$E_{o}(n_{i,v}) = 1 / (1 + e^{-k(n_{i,v} - n_{o,50})})$

Note that this model can equivalently be interpreted as there being a different deterministic threshold for each different *event* whereby that outcome would occur in the absence of vaccination, and would not occur if the neutralisation level is above the random threshold, where the random thresholds are drawn from a logistic distribution with location parameter $n_{o,50}$ and scale parameter $1/k$.

At the population level, the efficacy of immunity against a given outcome from a given variant in a cohort with mean neutralisation level $\mu_{s,d,v}$ is the average probability over the whole population of the outcome being averted. This is computed by integrating the sigmoid function with respect to the normal distribution of neutralisation levels. This integral has no closed form, so must be computed by numerical approximation (Gauss-Legendre quadrature).

$P_{s,d,o,v} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} E_{o}(n_v)f(n_v | \mu_{s,d,v}, \sigma^2) dn_v$

The mean neutralisation level $\mu_{s,d,v}$ for a cohort with immunity source $s$ and number of days $d$ since peak immunity from that source is assumed to follow exponential decay with half-life of $H$ days, from a peak mean neutralisation level against that variant of $\mu^*_{s,v}$ for each source:

$\mu_{s,d} = log10(10 ^ {\mu^*_{s,v}} e^{-d/H})$

The peak mean neutralisation level against a given variant is in turn modelled as a log10 fold increase or decrease in neutralising antibody titres that variant, relative to an index variant:

$\mu^*_{s,v} = \mu^*_{s,0} + F^v$

Where for the index variant $F^v = 0$, for a variant with immune escape relative to the index the $F^v < 1$, and for a variant more susceptible to neutralisation than the index, $F^v > 1$.

Among these model parameters, $\mu^*_{s,0}$, $F^v$, $H$, $\sigma^2$ can be estimated from neutralisation assay experiments. The parameters $n_{o,50}$ (one per outcome) and $k$ (one in total) must be learned by fitting the model to data on population-level vaccine efficacy. In this Bayesian implementation, the parameter $\sigma^2$ is kept fixed at the value estimated by [Cromer et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00267-6), $\mu^*_{s,0}$, $F^v$, and $h$ are given informative priors based on estimates from [Khoury et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01377-8) and [Cromer et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00267-6), and the remaining parameters are given less  informative priors. This enables the model to update these parameters slightly based on the data, and fully incorporate uncertainty in these parameters into predictions.

This model is fitted to estimates from [Andrews et al. (2021a)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.15.21263583) of the population-level efficacy of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines (two doses) against clinical outcomes (death, severe disease, symptomatic infection) from the Delta variant over different periods of time post-administration, and estimates from [Pouwels et al. (2021)](ttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260) and from [Eyre et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260) against acquisition (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and onward transmission of breakthrough infections, respectively, of the Delta variant.

The model likelihood for vaccine efficacy estimate $j$ is defined as a normal distribution over the logit-transformed estimate $\text{VE}_j$, with mean given by the logit-transformed predicted efficacy for that combination of source, days post-administration, outcome, and variant $P_{s_j,d_j,o_j,v_j}$ and with variance given by the sum of the square of the standard error of the estimate on the logit scale $\text{logit-SE}^2_{j}$ (approximated from provided uncertainty intervals), and an additional variance term $\sigma^2_{\text{ve}}$, to represent any additional errors in these estimates that may arise from inference on observational data:

$\text{logit}(\text{VE}_j) \sim N(\text{logit}(P_{s_j,d_j,o_j,v_j}), \text{logit-SE}^2_{j} + \sigma^2_{\text{ve}})$

All VE estimates covered events over a period of time, and $d_j$ was taken as the midpoint of that period.

### Extension to Omicron

The vaccine efficacy model provides a method by which to map between vaccine efficacies for different variants, outcomes, sources of immunity, and degrees of waning. For a given value of the Omicron immune escape parameter $F^\text{O}$ relative to Delta (with relative escape parameter $F^\Delta = 0$) as an index variant, it is possible to infer the degree of immune protection against acquisition and transmission for a cohort with a given level of immunity. Combined with the fraction of the population with some immunity, this enables estimation of the reduction in transmission that could be expected, and therefore the intrinsic transmissibility ($R_0$) that the variant must possess to explain observed rates of reproduction of the virus. Given $F^\text{O}$ it is also possible to predict vaccine efficacy against Omicron. 

The parameter $F^\text{O}$ could be estimated directly from neutralisation assays against Omicron. Since these are not yet available, this analysis instead infers plausible values of $F^\text{O}$ by treating it as a latent parameter in a Bayesian model, and fitting the model to observational data on both reinfection rates and reproduction rates of Delta and Omicron in South Africa. Note that the aim of this analysis is not to provide a precise estimate of any of these things, but to infer the range of values that are consistent with available data, whilst accounting for and incorporating as many sources of uncertainty as is possible.

Given the latent parameter $F^\text{O}$, the model defines three likelihoods over different sources of data:

 - estimates of the reinfection hazard ratio from [Pulliam et al. (2021)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.21266068v2) for the recent period and for the period of the Delta wave
 
 - estimates of the current reproduction number of Delta from a presentation by [Carl Pearson, SACMC](https://twitter.com/cap1024/status/1466840869852651529)
 
 - estimates of the ratio of the reproduction numbers of Omicron compared to Delta (as estimated from SGTF vs non-SGTF case counts) from the same presentation
 
Broadly, these three parameters each inform three different unknowns in the model: reinfection hazard ratios inform the degree of immune escape of Omicron, relative to Delta; the reproduction number of Delta informs the degree of immunity against Delta infection; and the ratio of reproduction numbers informs the intrinsic transmissibility of Omicron relative to Delta, after accounting for the degree of immune protection against each. The likelihoods for these three sources of data are detailed in turn below.

Note that all variables in the model that are uncertain and can influence the estimates of transmissibility or immune escape are treated as unknown parameters, even if thery  are not quantities of interest or if they are not identified from the data. This enables integration over uncertainty in these parameters (ie. a Monte Carlo simulation) whilst estimating parameters of interest.

#### Reinfection hazard ratios

[Pulliam et al. (2021)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.21266068v2) provide modelled estimates over time of the ratio between two hazards (rates of occurrence per unit time): the new infection hazard (rate of new infections per person without previous infection), and the reinfection hazard (rate of new infections among people who have had a previous infection). These estiamtes are informed by data on sequential infections from routine surveillance, and their model accounts for imperfect and differential case ascertainment between the two groups. They also provide an estimate of the ratio of these two hazards.

Since the force of infection will likely be the same for the two groups, the ratio of the reinfection hazard to the infection hazard can be interpreted as a proxy for the relative risk of infection between immune and non-immune individuals. This can be loosely interpreted as an estimate of one minus the efficacy of prior immunity against symptomatic infection (because the detection process is likely dependent on clinical presentation). Comparing the observed values of this parameter for the recent period (approximately 0.3) and the Delta wave (approximately 0.1) against the values predicted by the vaccine efficacy model for the dominant variants for a given $F^\text{O}$ (and an assumed mean neutralisation level among those with immunity) enables quantitative inference about the degree of immune escape of Omicron relative to Delta. Since this is a heavily modelled estimate and that vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease (to which the model is calibrated) will be somewhat different from immunity against (detectable) reinfection, a large degree of uncertainty is assigned to these observations.

The likelihood for this data source is as follows:

$log(\hat{r}_\text{O}) = log(1 - P_{S,D,\text{symptoms},\text{O}}) + \gamma$

$log(\hat{r}_\Delta) = log(1 - P_{S,D,\text{symptoms},\Delta}) + \gamma$

$log(r_\text{O}) \sim N(log(\hat{r}_\text{O}), \sigma_r^2)$

$log(r_\Delta) \sim N(log(\hat{r}_\Delta), \sigma_r^2)$

where $log(r_v)$ denotes the log of the value, and $log(\hat{r}_v)$ the log of the expected value of the reinfection hazard ratio during the period dominated by variant $v$ ($\text{O}$ indicating Omicron and $\Delta$ Delta), computed from the log of one minus the expected efficacy of prior immunity against symptomatic disease, corrected by a log-offset parameter $\gamma$ to absorb any multiplicative bias in the hazard ratios (e.g. due to an incorrect specification of the ascertainment parameters in the model used to infer the hazard ratios). $P_{S,D,\text{symptoms},v}$ is the population-level efficacy against symptomatic disease from variant $v$, given immunity source $S$, $D$ days since peak immunity. This is defined by  the parameters of the vaccine effect model, $F_\text{O}$, and a parameter $\mu^*_{s,0}$ for the baseline peak level of immunity against the index variant (Delta), with standard half normal prior to enforce that those with prior immunity must have had at minimum the level of immunity conferred by a single wild-type infection. $D$ has a normal prior with mean of 120 days and standard deviation of 20 days, to represent the average time since infection in the Delta wave. $\sigma_r = 0.25$ to reflect a significant degree of uncertainty in the relationship between these estimates and the adjusted relative risks, and $r_\text{O} = 0.3$ and $r_{\Delta} = 0.1$, which were read off Figure 5 in [Pulliam et al. (2021)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.21266068v2).

#### Delta reproduction number

Whilst the Delta variant is estimated to have the highest intrinsic transmissibility of variants so far identified (estimates range from 6-8), estimates of the reproduction number in Gauteng Province, South Africa at the time of the Omicron outbreak are largely just below 1, indicating declining case counts. There were minimal lockdown or distancing restrictions in place in Gauteng province during this time, and [estimates of mobility](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) indicate that mixing rates are largely at or above baseline levels (with the exception of visits to workplaces at a 7% reduction). The majority of the reduction in transmission from R0 conditions in Gauteng is therefore likely to be prior immunity from previous epidemic waves, with some additional effect of vaccination. Given the multiple waves of infections with different variants (wild-type, Beta, Delta), and evidence of multiple renfections over this period (see Figure in [Pulliam et al. (2021)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.21266068v2)) the level of immunity, and especially protection against Delta is likely to be considerably higher than the protection provided by a single infection against wild-type SARS-CoV-2. This degree of immunity can therefore be inferred from an assumed R0 and estimate of the effective reproduction number, given some assumptions about the fraction with any immunity ($Q$) and the effect of human behaviour, public health and social measures, and isolation of cases on transmission ($C$).

The likelihood on recent estimates of the reproduction number of Delta in Gauteng Province is defined as as:
  
$\hat{R}_{\text{eff}}^\Delta = R_0^\Delta * (1 - C) * I^\Delta$

$log(R_{\text{eff}}^\Delta) \sim N(log(\hat{R}_{\text{eff}}^\Delta), \sigma^2_R)$

The reduction in transmission of the Delta variant due to immunity $I_\Delta$ is calculated as the product of the population-level reductions due to the efficacy of immunity against acquisition ($A_\Delta$) and onward transmission of breakthrough infections ($T_\Delta$), each of which is calculated from the corresponding immune efficacy for Delta, given the modelled level of peak immunity and time since peak (as above) and the fraction of the population with immunity $Q$.

$A_\Delta = Q (1 - P_{S,D,\text{acquisition},\Delta}) + (1 - Q)$

$T_\Delta = Q (1 - P_{S,D,\text{transmission},\Delta}) + (1 - Q)$

$I_\Delta = A_\Delta * T_\Delta$

$Q$ is assigned an informative normal prior with mean 0.8 and standard deviation 0.05 (70-90% have some immunity), truncated to the unit interval. To be conservative (leaning towards lower levels of immunity effect and therefore higher intrinsic transmissibility), it is assumed that $R_{0,\Delta} = 6$, at the lower end of international estimates, and that $C$ has a normal prior distribution with mean 0.2 (20% reduction in transmission), a standard deviation 0.1, and truncated between 0 and 0.5 (maximum 50% reduction). $R_{\text{eff}}^\Delta = 0.8$ and $\sigma^2_R = 0.2$ estimates are obtained from [Pearson, SACMC estimates](https://twitter.com/cap1024/status/1466840869852651529).


#### Reproduction number ratio

[Pearson, SACMC](https://twitter.com/cap1024/status/1466840869852651529) provides a time-varying estimate of the ratio of the effective reproduction number of Omicron to Delta in Gauteng Province, with quantification of uncertainty. This estimate was computed from timeseries of case counts with (assumed Omicron) and without (assumed Delta) S-gene target failure. The expected reproduction number for each variant can be computed as per $\hat{R}_{\text{eff}}^\Delta$ above and the ratio computed, however since the non-immunity reduction term $1 - C$ contributes to both variants (those effects are likely to  have the same effect on both variant), this cancels out and gives the following esxpression for the ration of reproduction numbers:

$\hat{R}_{\text{eff}}^\text{O}/\hat{R}_{\text{eff}}^\Delta = (R_0^\text{O}/R_0^\Delta) (I_\Delta / I_\text{O})$

$R_{\text{eff}}^\text{O}/R_{\text{eff}}^\Delta \sim N(\hat{R}_{\text{eff}}^\text{O}/\hat{R}_{\text{eff}}^\Delta, \sigma_\text{Reff})$
 
$R_{\text{eff}}^\text{O}/R_{\text{eff}}^\Delta = 2.1$ and $\sigma_\text{Reff} = 0.41$ to match the distribution from Pearson (across estimates with the same and different generation intervals between variants.


### Omicron vaccine efficacy estimates

[Andrews et al. (2021b)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267615) provide estimates of vaccine efficacy against Omicron for different products, numbers of doses, and periods post-vaccination. These estimates provide direct information on the degree of immune escape of Omicron versus Delta. The provided estimates for efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccination against Omicron are however highly uncertain and have negative point estimates, and the authors note that these estimates are likely to be untrustworthy due to the fact that AstraZeneca vaccinees are more likely to be vulnerable (and so more prone to clinical disease). For this reason, estimates of efficacy of vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine were excluded, as were any efficacy estimates computed on fewer than 10 Omicron cases (e.g. Pfizer dose 2 in the period immediately following vaccination). Estimates are also provided of vaccine efficacy against Delta. Among Delta estimates, the majority are likely to have been computed using the same underlying data as was used to estimate the efficacies against clinical disease in the baseline model, however the efficacy estimate for booster doses against Delta is independent of these, and so we include this. These additional vaccine efficacy estimates were used to inform the model with a likelihood defined as described above.

### Fitting the model

The model is defined, fitted, and predicted from using the greta R package. Inference is performed with 10 independent chains of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, each run for 1000 samples after 1000 (discarded) warmup iterations. Convergence is assessed by the potential scale reduction factor statistic (1.01 or less for all parameters), the effective sample size (greater than 500 for all parameters) and visual inspection of trace plots.

These posterior samples are used to visualise the joint posterior distribution over immune escape and transmissibility of Omicron, relative to Delta, via a kernel density estimate over pairs of parameter samples. Immune escape is calculated as:

$1 - (1 - I_\text{O}) / (1 - I_\Delta)$

but with $Q$ fixed at 1. Ie. it is the reduction in the effect of immunity on transmission shown by Omicron, relative to Delta, in a fully immune cohort.

The posterior distributions over vaccine efficacies for different ourcomes, products, doses, and dregrees of waning are computed to predict the range likely efficacies that might be expected with Omicron 

For choices of prior distributions, see [here](R/build_neut_model.R) for the main vaccine efficacy model and [here](R/add_omicron_model.R) for extensions to inferring the transmissibility and immune escape of Omicron. See [here](R/analysis) for more details of model fitting, and an overview of the entire analysis.
